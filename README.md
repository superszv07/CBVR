Project: Content-Based Video Retrieval

Overview

This project aims to develop a video retrieval system capable of efficiently locating similar videos within a large dataset based on their visual content. By leveraging deep learning techniques, specifically the ResNet-50 model, we extract meaningful feature representations from video frames. These features are then stored in a compressed format for efficient retrieval. A similarity search mechanism, employing cosine similarity, is implemented to identify the most relevant videos to a given query video.

Key Technologies

Python: Core programming language for model implementation and data processing.
TensorFlow: Framework for loading and utilizing the ResNet-50 model to extract features.
OpenCV: Library for processing and handling video data, including frame extraction and resizing.
NumPy: Library for numerical operations, matrix manipulations, and efficient feature storage.
Pandas: Library for managing and loading metadata from CSV files.
scikit-learn: Library providing cosine similarity functionality for similarity measurement.
Dataset

The UCF101 dataset is used to train and evaluate the model. It contains 13,320 video clips across 101 action categories, providing a diverse range of video content.

Model Architecture

Preprocessing Video Frames:

Extract frames from the video using OpenCV.
Resize frames to a standard size suitable for the ResNet-50 model.
Preprocess frames by normalizing pixel values and applying data augmentation techniques (e.g., random cropping, flipping).
Feature Extraction Using ResNet-50:

Feed preprocessed frames into the pre-trained ResNet-50 model.
Extract feature vectors from the final convolutional layer of the network.
These feature vectors represent high-level visual features of the video frames.
Saving and Loading Feature Vectors:

Store extracted feature vectors in a compressed format (e.g., NumPy array or HDF5 file) for efficient storage.
Load feature vectors from the storage when needed for similarity search.
Cosine Similarity for Video Retrieval:

Calculate cosine similarity between the feature vector of the query video and the feature vectors of all videos in the dataset.
Rank videos based on their cosine similarity scores.
Retrieve the top-ranked videos as the most relevant results.
Precision and Recall Calculation:

Evaluate the retrieval system's performance using precision and recall metrics.
Precision measures the proportion of retrieved videos that are relevant.
Recall measures the proportion of relevant videos that are retrieved

# Future Work

 Fine-tuning ResNet-50: Experiment with fine-tuning the ResNet-50 model on the UCF101 dataset to improve feature extraction.
 Hybrid Retrieval: Combine content-based retrieval with text-based retrieval for more comprehensive search.
 time Retrieval: Optimize the system for real-time video retrieval applications.
 User Feedback Integration: Incorporate user feedback to refine the retrieval system's recommendations.
